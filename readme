* ========================================== *


========== Overview ==========
This is a manual for managing the website of TSAIL. It first introduces the general framework of the website and the
function of each page. Then, for those info that changes frequently, we introduce how to update them.


========== Framework ==========
This website follows a simple design. It has several htmls: index.html people.html projects.html publications.html and
resources.html. They are all static and each one is a single web page. One can navigate from one to another using the
bar located at the top of each page (the default page is index page).

Our website follows a responsive design, which is implemented using Bootstrap framework. In that case, the page can be
easily displayed in mobile devices. Bootstrap provides some css and js codes. Note that we only include its online url,
so if someday the cdn is broken then our css will be broken too.


========== Page Functions ==========
index.html: Displays our research overview and some news

people.html: Displays our current lab members and alumni as well as accesses to their personal pages

projects.html: Displays our ongoing projects such as their names and corresponding brief descriptions

publications.html: A chronological list of publications in our lab

resources.html: A page where you can put your open-source/project code for download


========== Information Update ==========
index.html: You can update news in index.html.

1. Find the <ul> </ul> tag
2. Add a <li> content </li> tag in it
3. if you'd like to change its color, you can use tag <li style="color: #ff0000"> content </li> (#ff0000 means red)



people.html: You can update members in people.html. In this page, members are grouped into several groups: faculty,
postdoc, grad student, undergrad and alumni. Each group is contained in a <div class="container"> ... <\div> tag. For
each member its code is like this

<div class="col-lg-2">
    <div class="tilt">
        <img width="110" height="110" alt="" src="imgs/file" class="img-circle">
    </div>
    <h4><a href="url_of_personal_page">name</a></h4>
    <p>interest</p>
</div>

If you want to delete a member, then find such structures with its name in it and delete the code. If you'd like to add
a member, then paste the code to certain container. The information you need to fill in is the path to his/her pictures
(src="imgs/file"), personal page url (href="url_of_personal_page", href="#" if none), name (name), and interest
(<p>interest</p>).

Note that if the group has less than 6 members, then you may need to add offset col-lg-offset-? in the FIRST member's
div like this <div class="col-lg-2 col-lg-offset-?">. Here the ? can be 0-12. The idea is that in Bootstrap, page is cut
horizontally into 12 columns, and col-lg-2 means this div takes 2 columns. So initially each row can show 6 members
(6x2=12). But if we have, for example, 2 members, then in order to put them in the center, we need to add offset at the
left of the FIRST member div. In that case, it's 4, since (4x2+2x2=12)

To manage the list of alumni, you can simply add or delete the <li> ... <\li> at the end of the page



projects.html: You update the projects info in this page. The projects are displayed in two columns. We implemented
using two container divs, where each of them has col-lg-6. Each project is presented using a panel like this:

<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3>name</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="imgs/file" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        add intro here
    </div>
</div>

To add/delete a project, you paste/delete such code in the certain panel. The info you need to fill in is: name of
projects (<h3>name</h3>), img of the project (src="imgs/file"), and a intro (<div class="panel-footer"> add intro here
</div>)



publications.html: You can update list of papers in publications.html. You can add/remove a paper by adding/deleting
the <li> ... </li> in the page.



resources.html: This page is originally intended to provide downloads for some project codes and data. But currently
there is none. If you'd like to put something on it, please contact the website manager to figure it out how to do this.
